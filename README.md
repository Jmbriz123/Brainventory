## c. Project Description
Brainventory is a GUI-based productivity system designed to help students build effective study habits, track academic progress, and see their learning consistency over time.  

The program allows users to record study sessions, organize subjects, and generate performance summaries such as total study time per subject or average study duration per day.  

This project will demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Javaâ€”namely **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **composition**â€”through well-structured class hierarchies and modular design. Brainventory encourages students to study smarter by promoting self-awareness and accountability through data-driven reflection.
